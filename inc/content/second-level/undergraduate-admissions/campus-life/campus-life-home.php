            <div class="content col-2">
                <p>At Stony Brook University, we offer outstanding academic programs, a thriving research environment, hundreds of clubs and activities, and a dynamic first-year experience in one of six small Undergraduate Communities. Living on campus puts you at the center of everything SB has to offer.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Location.</strong> Our six traditional quads and undergraduate apartments are within easy walking distance of the Academic Mall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Furnishings.</strong> All rooms come furnished with an extra-long twin bed, desk, chair, dresser, and bookcase for each resident, have high-speed access to the Internet, and are equipped with state-of-the-art phone systems featuring conference calling and call forwarding. A cable access connection in each room provides Cablevision’s® premium service (currently offering HBO1 and 2).</li>
                    <li><strong>Computing.</strong> All rooms offer high-speed Internet access. Each quad also has its own state-of-the-art computing center open seven days a week, offering daytime and late-night hours for residents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fitness.</strong> Each quad has its own fitness center featuring Nautilus and Cybex equipment. Some fitness centers offer aerobics classes, and all are staffed by trained students who can provide assistance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Staff.</strong> Our diverse staff includes Quad Directors, Residence Hall Directors, and administrative offices within each quad. Each Residence Hall is supervised by a full-time, live-in professional Residence Hall Director who is available daily for guidance on academic and interpersonal issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transportation.</strong> The University bus system provides free service seven days a week around campus and to a major indoor mall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Our Housing Guarantee.</strong> Students in good standing who enter the University as freshmen and successfully complete all required room selection processes are guaranteed eight semesters of campus housing (six semesters of housing for those entering as transfers).</li>

Eligibility will depend upon the timely receipt of both the tuition/housing deposit and new student preferences, as well as the actual availability of space.
