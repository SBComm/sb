            <h3>Stony Brook Makes Title IX Strides</span></h3>
            <div class="content col-2 col-2-left">
                <p>Stony Brook University is firmly committed to creating and fostering a learning and working environment in which all members of our community can thrive. We're actively focused on developing targeted initiatives and offering resources to educate and inform our campus about sexual violence, discrimination and misconduct.</p>
                <h4>What Exactly is Title IX?</h4>
                <p><a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html" target="_blank" class="external-link">Title IX</a> is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in every educational program or activity that is federally funded. At Stony Brook, the law protects all students, faculty and staff from sexual discrimination, including all forms of sexual misconduct, harassment and violence.</p>
