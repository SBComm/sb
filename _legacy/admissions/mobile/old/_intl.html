<p><strong>International Admissions </strong><br />
Stony Brook is a highly selective institution, seeking to enroll those students who demonstrate the intellectual curiosity and academic ability to succeed.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em><strong>Freshman Applicants</strong></em> must have completed the highest level of secondary education in your country of residence. We look for a strong secondary academic program with courses in math, natural sciences, and English (or, if English is the language of instruction, another language).<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> <em><strong>Transfer Applicants </strong></em>are required to have performed well in a strong academic program, having completed at least 24 credits with a GPA of 3.0 or higher by the time they submit their application. If the applicant has earned fewer than 24 credits, high school credentials must also be submitted.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>English Proficiency</strong><br />
  The TOEFL, IELTS examination, or SAT must be taken by anyone whose native language is not English, even if you have attended high school in the United States.</p>
