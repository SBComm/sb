 <p><strong>Transfer Admissions</strong></p>
 <p>The typical successful transfer applicant will have completed at least 24 credits with a GPA of 3.0 or higher by the time they submit their application. </p>
 <p> Applicants with fewer than 24 credits at the time of application must also submit high school transcripts and standardized test scores.  Only students with strong secondary school credentials will be considered for admission.</p>
 <p>Special consideration will be given to qualified graduates of university-parallel programs, i.e., A.A. and A.S. degree recipients from colleges within the State University of New York and City University of New York systems. Students are not, however, guaranteed admission into the program of their choice. Graduates of career-oriented programs (A.A.S. and A.O.S.) will be considered for admission on an individual basis and in competition with other transfer applicants.</p>

 <p><strong>Transfer Credit Policies </strong></p>
 <p>All credits earned at a regionally-accredited college or university with a letter grade of &lsquo;C&rsquo; or higher will be accepted and evaluated for specific degree requirements by the major department.  Transfer applicants must submit transcripts from all colleges attended and for all semesters in school, including &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; courses.
